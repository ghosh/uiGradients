This is the repo for [uigradients.com](http://uigradients.com) - A handpicked collection of beautiful colour gradients for design and code.

Hopefully this little effort will help you draw inspiration and serve as a resource for picking gradients for your own projects. 


### Contributors

A huge thank you to all the contributors. A complete list can be found [here](https://github.com/Ghosh/uiGradients/graphs/contributors).

### Contributing

Adding a gradient to the library is super simple. All the gradients are loaded and rendered from a single `gradients.json` file.

To add your gradient, fork this repository, add your two gradient colours in the HEX format along with a name to the end of the json file and submit a pull request. Don't forget the commas!
